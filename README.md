# üçû Sandwiches (SwiftUI Sample, Modernized)

This project is a **modernized version** of the classic [WWDC20 session 10119: *Introduction to SwiftUI*](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10119/).  
Back then, the app demonstrated SwiftUI with `@StateObject`, `ObservableObject`, and `@Published`.  
In this update, we refactored it to use Apple‚Äôs **new [Observation framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/observation)** introduced at WWDC23, replacing the old property wrappers.
